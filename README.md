Hello World!

I am supposed to tell you something about myself here: I am not really familiar with coding or anything that has to do with programming. I am working on my PhD in Latin Literature and am interested in finding tools to help me analyse my data, to visualise and organise my findings, and to make my work as a researcher a bit easier/faster. 
At the moment, I am especially interested in the Ann√©e Philologique and its development, so I am part of a focus group that's working here on Github.
